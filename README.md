# PyQt-Morse-code-translator

As I made one of these Morse code translators in Javascript, I thought I would make one (or two in this case) using Python.

This contains two independent Morse code encoders.
One that works in the console, and another that creates a GUI using PyQt5.



These both work with Python version 3.8.x and above

In order for the GUI to work you will need to install a few extra packages using pip.
Please make sure you have initiated a virtual environment before installing packages for PyQt5

To install these packages, clone the repo, cd into it and run the command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The CLI file can be run as is and is run via a single function, and does not need any specially installed packages.
